Task 1a:

1. Assumpions in bicycle model - Recorded data vx and SWA are accurate.

2. Assumptions in integrator - Recorded data yawRate, vx and ay are accurate.

Task 1a Results comments:

The integrator has a weird result because of the bank angle at the Lunda airfield. The accelerometer always has a component of the bank angle and that eroors keeps adding up in the integrator with time.
